## Hello Fellow Web Wizards ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate coding enthusiast who thrives on crafting smart, scalable solutions using TypeScript and modern frameworks like Next.js, React, and Angular. Currently, I'm proudly part of the talented team at [Sudorandom Labs](https://sudoswap.xyz), and I've previously enjoyed roles at [Lighthouse Global](https://lighthouseglobal.com), [Insight Enterprises](https://www.insight.com/), and [Responsive Data](https://www.responsivedata.com/).

Beyond the code editor, you'll find me scaling the peaks of complex UI challenges or exploring innovative backend architectures. When not coding, I'm usually rock climbing, tinkering with generative AI projects, or perfecting my sourdough baking skillsâ€”a hobby I started long before it became trendy during quarantine!
